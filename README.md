# AquariumSimulation
This is simulation of an aquarium in 2 dimensions. The fish determines how to behave by using cellular automaton. <br />
At the start, you adjust the parameters to keep the balance between preys and the predator in the aquarium<br />
Once you started, you cannot interfere. Simulation runs until the predator dies or reproduction of preys get out of control <br />
